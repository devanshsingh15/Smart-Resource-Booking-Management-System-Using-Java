# 📊 Smart Resource Booking & Management System (SRBMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
**SRBMS** is a layered, console-based Java application built using **Maven**. It efficiently manages the booking and allocation of shared resources (like rooms) and follows a clean architecture with `DTO`, `DAO`, `Service`, `UI`, `Util`, and `Exception` layers.

This project demonstrates Core Java concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Collections**, **Exception Handling**, **Custom Sorting**, **Java Time API**, and **JUnit 5 testing**, making it ideal for both learning and demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 **User Authentication & Role Management**
  - Secure sign-up/sign-in system  
  - Role-based access: Admin, Resource Manager, and Regular User

- 🏢 **Resource & Booking Management**  
  - Add, edit, delete, and view resources  
  - Book resources for a time period  
  - Custom sorting of rooms/bookings (by date, duration, name, etc.)  

- ⚠️ **Conflict Detection & Exception Handling**  
  - Prevent double bookings  
  - Custom exceptions for invalid input, unavailable resources, and access violations

- 📊 **Reporting & Analytics**  
  - List all bookings  
  - View bookings by user or resource  
  - Statistics and sorting capabilities
